This is my grandmother's apple pie :)

Crust:	
2 cups flour	
1/2 t salt, rounded	
3/4 cup shortening, rounded	
1/3 cup cold water	
	
Pie:	
4-5 cooking apples - Gravenstein, Granny Smith or Macintosh
1 cup sugar	Cinnamon
Butter	1 T flour
Lemon juice, optional	

Crust:
Mix flour and salt.  Add shortening and cut in until pieces are about the size of peas.  Add water until just mixed (might not need all the water).  Split dough into two parts, one slightly larger than the other.  Roll out the larger piece and place in a 9" pie pan, with at least 1/2" dough beyond the edges of the pan.  Set aside and cover with damp paper towel or cloth to keep it from drying out while the apples are prepared.  Roll out second piece, big enough to cover the top to the outer edge of the pie pan.  Cut some decorative air holes in the dough, but not too close to the edges.  Cover with damp cloth.

Pie filling:
Peel and cut up apples.  Add lemon juice if the apples are not tart enough.  Mix the sugar, cinnamon (to taste) and flour.  Add enough to the apples to lightly coat them.  Put apples in the pie shell and top with several pea-sized pieces of butter.  Lay top crust over the pan.  Press the top crust onto the apples - the apples will shrink so you want the crust to be as close to them as possible to start with.  Use a little water to dampen between the two crusts along the lip of the pie pan.  Cut off all except about 1/2" of the excess crust.  Roll the excess 1/2" under the lower crust, then crimp the edges.
Bake at 425° for 15 minutes, then reduce heat to 375° for 45 minutes or until the apples are done when tested with a toothpick through the air holes.
